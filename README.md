# React Financial Charts: Spark Fork

This repository is a fork of [react-financial-charts](https://github.com/react-financial/react-financial-charts/) with minor UI customizations.
Customizations at this point are limited to the `series` and `axes` packages.

### Use the forked library
1. Add the spark npm repository to your `.npmrc` \
   `npm config set @spark:registry https://artifactoryus.sparksystems.sg:8443`
2. Install the packages with the `@spark` scope \
   `npm install @spark/react-finacial-charts-series @spark/react-financial-charts-axes`
3. Import from the components as required
   ```
   import { CandlestickSeries } from '@spark/react-financial-charts-series';
   import { XAxis } from '@spark/react-financial-charts-axes';
   ```
   
### Create a release
1. Create a `-RC` or `-PA` branch
2. Commit changes with messages following the [conventional commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org) style of commit messages \
   â†’ The commit messages will be used for the changelog
3. Approve the release job in Circle CI
   - This will create a release commit and with tag
   - The tag will trigger a `publish` job, publishing the package to the spark repository

# React Financial Charts

> **Note:** this repo is a fork of [react-stockcharts](https://github.com/rrag/react-stockcharts), renamed, converted to typescript and bug fixes applied due to the original project being unmaintained.

> **Note:** v1 is a fully breaking change with large parts, if not all, rewritten. Do not expect the same API! although the same features should exist.
